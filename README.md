The Musical Lake

One day, an explorer started following some strange sounds, he then arrived at a lake where he found the source: 3 little animals doing music-like-sounds.

A short time passed, and the explorer was able to differentiate which animal produced which sound.

Sounds

Frog: brr, birip, brrah, croac
Dragonfly: fiu, plop, pep
Criket: cric-cric, trri-trri, bri-bri
After a while he discovered that they where "singing" together. Whenever the frog started with brr, the dragonfly responded to his sound rubbing its tail with a branch producing a sound as fiu, after the dragonfly, the criket continued with cric-cric but, everytime the frog sounded as brrah or croac all animals would mute for a while, and then they continued all over again. Before the sky was dark the explorer was able to write 3 "songs" they all did together and came up with these notes.

Songs

brr, fiu, cric-cric, brrah
pep, birip, trri-trri, croac
bri-bri, plop, cric-cric, brrah
Exercise

Using Angular 5, write a program that lets you receive a given sound from the list of sounds each animal does and returns the remaining sounds of any of the 3 songs that the explorer wrote e.g.:

When given brr it should reproduce fiu, cric-cric, brrah according to the first song
When given birip it should reproduce trri-trri, croac according to the second song
When given plop it should reproduce cric-cric, brrah according to the third song
When given croac or brrah it shouldn't reproduce anything according to all songs
Note: You'll get extra points if you:

Don't repeat yourself, for example do not duplicate the same values of a list into another list.
Don't forget to add your test suite.
Avoid nested if as much as you can.
